#' Discretize one-dimensional continuous data into bins
#'
#' The function of discretize1D is used to assign the observations of a set of continuous random variables to bins,
#' and returns a corresponding one-dimensional count table. Two of the most common discretization methods are available:
#' "uniform width" and "uniform frequency".
#'
#' Uniform width-based method ("uniform_width") divides the continuous data into N bins with equal width,
#' while Uniform frequency-based method ("uniform_frequency") divides the continuous data into N bins with (approximate) equal count number.
#' By default in both methods, the number of bins N is initialized into a round-off value according to the square root of the data size.
#' @param x a numeric vector of the random variable x.
#' @param algorithm two discretization algorithms are available, "uniform_width" is the default.
#'
#' @return discretize1D returns a one-dimensional count table.
